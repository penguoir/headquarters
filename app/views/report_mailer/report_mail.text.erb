Weekly report for <%= @user.display_name %>
<%= "=" * ('Weekly report for '.length + @user.display_name.length) %>

This report is for the week starting on <%= Date.today.beginning_of_week.strftime '%d/%m/%Y' %>.


Pinned projects (<%= @user.pinned_projects.length %>)
<%= "-" * (18 + @user.pinned_projects.size.digits.count) %>

These are projects that the student has pinned to their dashboard. They're
probably spending most of their time on some of these.

<%- @user.pinned_projects.each do |project| %>
  * <%= project.title %>
<% end %>


Resources added in the last week (<%= @resources.size %>)
<%= "-" * (35 + @resources.size.digits.count) %>

Resources are pieces of knowledge the student has shared with their class.
These have been added in the past week.

<%- @resources.each do |resource| %>
  * <%= resource.title %>
<% end %>


Happy learning!
